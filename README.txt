This project was created based on the paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam.[1]
Code is a modified version of the sample code provided alongside the paper, which was adapted to use C++ and SFML rather than C and OpenGL.
This was created for the purpose of testing optimization methods as part of my CSC485C coursework.

Core algorithms for the simulation can be found in RTFD_[VERSION].cpp files 
Experiment setup code can be found in demo.cpp
Global variables and indexing functions can be found in project.h
